### **AI Trends Analysis**

1. **`data_analysis/`**
   - Contains the analysis script `AITrendsAnalysis_analysis.ipynb`.
   - This script processes the collected datasets to extract insights, visualize trends, and perform comparative analyses across sources.

2. **`data_collection/`**
   - Contains scripts for collecting data:
     - `reddit_data.ipynb`: Fetches posts from AI-related subreddits using the Reddit API.
     - `semantic_scholar_data.ipynb`: Retrieves metadata for research papers on AI topics using the Semantic Scholar API.
     - `wikipedia_data.ipynb`: Collects daily pageviews and metadata for AI-related topics via the Wikimedia API.

3. **`data/`**
   - Stores the CSV files generated by the collection scripts:
     - `reddit_data.csv`: Contains Reddit posts with metadata.
     - `semantic_scholar_data.csv`: Metadata of research papers.
     - `wikipedia_data.csv`: Daily pageviews and metadata for Wikipedia topics.

4. **`visualizations/plots/`**
   - Contains visualizations generated during analysis.
   - Includes plots in both HTML and PNG formats for easier sharing and embedding.
