### **AI Trends Analysis**

1. **`data_analysis/`**
   - Contains the analysis script `AITrendsAnalysis_analysis.ipynb`.
   - This script processes the collected datasets to extract insights, visualize trends, and perform comparative analyses across sources.

2. **`data_collection/`**
   - Contains scripts for collecting data:
     - `reddit_data.ipynb`: Fetches posts from AI-related subreddits using the Reddit API.
     - `semantic_scholar_data.ipynb`: Retrieves metadata for research papers on AI topics using the Semantic Scholar API.
     - `wikipedia_data.ipynb`: Collects daily pageviews and metadata for AI-related topics via the Wikimedia API.

3. **`visualizations/`**
   - Contains visualizations generated during analysis.
   - Includes plots in both HTML and PNG formats for easier sharing and embedding.

## File Descriptions

### **Data Collection Scripts**

1. **`reddit_data.ipynb`**
   - Collects posts from AI-related subreddits such as *MachineLearning*, *ArtificialIntelligence*, *datascience*, etc.
   - Captures metadata including post title, URL, score, number of comments, awards, and subreddit name.

2. **`semantic_scholar_data.ipynb`**
   - Fetches research papers published between 2014â€“2024 on topics like Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, etc.
   - Metadata includes title, authors, year of publication, citation count, abstract, venue, and URL.

3. **`wikipedia_data.ipynb`**
   - Collects pageviews and metadata for AI-related Wikipedia topics.
   - Captures daily pageviews over the past decade along with metadata such as article title, creation date, last modified date, categories, and description.

### **Data Analysis Script**

4. **`AITrendsAnalysis_analysis.ipynb`**
   - Analyzes the collected datasets to uncover trends in public interest (Reddit), research activity (Semantic Scholar), and topic popularity (Wikipedia).
   - Performs tasks such as:
     - Visualizing trends over time.
     - Comparing engagement levels across platforms.
     - Identifying emerging topics in AI.

## Outputs

The project generates three main datasets:
1. **Reddit Dataset**: CSV file with posts from monitored subreddits about AI-related discussions.
2. **Semantic Scholar Dataset**: CSV file containing metadata for research papers on various AI topics.
3. **Wikipedia Dataset**: CSV file with daily pageviews and metadata for AI-related Wikipedia pages
4. **Plots & Visualizations:** - all html and png files - plots from datasets analysis to discover AI trends.
